\chapter{Analyzing the problem}

\lettrine{B}{efore writing a single} line of code or ordering any components, you must crystallize exactly what problem you're solving. This chapter presents a systematic framework for transforming vague business requirements into concrete technical architecture.

Most hardware projects fail not because of technical limitations, but because the problem was never properly defined. I've seen teams spend months building elegant solutions to the wrong problem, only to discover their fundamental assumptions were flawed.

\section{The Problem Definition Framework}

Every successful device project starts with answering one fundamental question: \textbf{What do I want to build?}

This seems obvious, but most initial problem statements are too vague for implementation. "I want to build a time attendance system" tells you nothing about authentication methods, data storage, network requirements, or user interface needs.

\subsection{Step 1: Core Function Definition}

Start with a single sentence that captures the essential transformation your device performs:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Example: Time Attendance Registrator]
\textbf{Core Function:} Upon user authentication, the device records an attendance event with timestamp and user identity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10,colframe=green!75!black,title=Example: Self-Service Beer Machine]
\textbf{Core Function:} Authenticate user, calculate beer price, process payment, dispense measured amount of beer, and display product information.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10,colframe=orange!75!black,title=Example: Smart Helmet]
\textbf{Core Function:} Stream real-time video and thermal imaging from field operations to command center while maintaining authentication and local storage backup.
\end{tcolorbox}



\subsection{Step 2: Core Function Problem Solve Proposal}

Once you've defined what your device does, determine how it will accomplish that core function. This step identifies the primary technical challenge and your proposed solution approach.

For each core function, ask: What is the most critical technical problem I need to solve?

\textbf{Time Attendance Registrator:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Challenge:} Reliably identifying users without manual input
\item \textbf{Solution Proposal:} RFID-based authentication with local database storage
\item \textbf{Why:} 99\% success rate (1\% is when employees share the card), low cost, works offline, minimal user training
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Self-Service Beer Machine:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Challenge:} Accurate volume measurement for variable pricing
\item \textbf{Solution Proposal:} Flow sensor with real-time price calculation
\item \textbf{Why:} Enables user-controlled portions while maintaining precise billing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Smart Helmet:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Challenge:} Real-time video transmission with network reliability issues
\item \textbf{Solution Proposal:} Local buffering with automatic upload when connectivity restored
\item \textbf{Why:} Ensures no data loss during network outages in mission-critical applications
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Step 3: Authentication Requirements Analysis}

Authentication patterns vary significantly across device types. Identify which pattern fits your project:

\textbf{Type 1: Local User Authentication (Time Attendance)}
User authenticates locally for service access, administrator authenticates remotely for reports and management.

\textbf{Type 2: Cloud-Connected User Authentication (Cybertap)}
User authenticates locally, but device must communicate with cloud to validate account balance and process transactions.

\textbf{Type 3: Device-to-Cloud Authentication (Smart Helmet)}
No user authentication - the helmet itself authenticates to cloud services using unique API key for secure communication.

\textbf{Time Attendance Registrator - Authentication Options:}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Success Rate} & \textbf{Cost} & \textbf{Complexity} \\
\hline
RFID Card & 99\% & Low & Low \\
QR Code Scan & 95\% & Low & Medium \\
Barcode Scan & 98\% & Low & Medium \\
Bluetooth Phone ID & 85\% & Medium & High \\
Fingerprint & 90\% & High & High \\
Face Recognition & 85\% & High & Very High \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Authentication method comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key insight:} RFID provides the best balance of reliability, cost, and implementation simplicity. Biometric options sound sophisticated but introduce significant complexity for marginal business value.


\subsection{Step 4: Interface Requirements}

List all required interfaces before considering implementation:

\textbf{Time Attendance System Interfaces:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Authentication Interface:} RFID reader, status LEDs, audio feedback
\item \textbf{Administrative Interface:} Web-based user management, report generation
\item \textbf{Network Interface:} Remote access for data export and system configuration

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Self-Service Beer Machine Interfaces:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User Interface:} Card reader, balance display, dispense button, volume display
\item \textbf{Product Interface:} Flow measurement sensor, flow control valve, temperature monitoring
\item \textbf{Device Interface:} Product identification (each device = one beer type), price per ml configuration
\item \textbf{Network Interface:} Card balance synchronization, transaction logging, device status reporting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Smart Helmet Interfaces:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Video Interface:} 4K camera, thermal imaging sensor, real-time streaming
\item \textbf{Communication Interface:} Command center authentication, network failover handling
\item \textbf{Storage Interface:} Local video buffering, automatic upload when connectivity restored
\item \textbf{Power Interface:} Battery management, charging protocols, power-saving modes
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture Mapping}

\section{Constraint Analysis}

Every project has hidden constraints that aren't obvious from the initial requirements. Identify these early:

\subsection{Physical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mounting requirements:} Time attendance device must be wall-mountable with standard hardware
\item \textbf{Chemical resistance:} Beer machine components must resist beer acid and cleaning chemicals
\item \textbf{Size limitations:} Smart helmet PCB must be compact enough to integrate into helmet design

\item \textbf{Power requirements:} Battery life, charging infrastructure, power consumption limits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Response time:} Attendance registration under 0.3 seconds (nobody likes to wait), beer dispense start under 2 seconds (somehow people likes beer more that time attendance :) )
\item \textbf{Accuracy requirements:} Payment processing 100\% accurate, video quality standards
\item \textbf{Reliability targets:} 99.9\% uptime, mean time between failures

\end{itemize}

\section{Common Analysis Mistakes}

Avoid these frequent errors that lead to project failure:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10,colframe=red!75!black,title=Warning: Feature Creep]
Resist the temptation to add "nice to have" features during analysis. Every additional feature exponentially increases complexity, cost, and failure probability. Focus ruthlessly on core requirements.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Other critical mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Underestimating power requirements:} Always measure actual power consumption, don't trust datasheets
\item \textbf{Ignoring certification requirements:} FCC, CE, safety certifications can add months to timeline
\item \textbf{Assuming perfect network connectivity:} Design for intermittent and unreliable networks
\item \textbf{Overlooking field serviceability:} Plan for diagnostics, updates, and repairs from day one
\end{itemize}

\section{Moving to Implementation}

The next step is translating this analysis into electronic interfaces and component selection. But first, validate your analysis with potential customers. 

Show them your interface requirements. Their feedback at this stage costs nothing to incorporate. Changes after you've ordered components cost everything.

Remember: hours spent in problem analysis save weeks in implementation and months in field debugging. The most expensive mistake is building the right solution to the wrong problem.
